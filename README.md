## Self Taught Front End Developer _(still learning)_

I am Mateusz Konefa≈Ç and I am 26 years old. Currently, I am learning programming. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, and I am currently focusing on front-end development and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, Python. 

Outside of work and study, I am interested in Linux, cybersecurity, video games (especially on consoles like Xbox and Nintendo Switch), electronics, and astrophysics.
